# BIL Support Foundation

[ This information needs to be filled in more completely by a member of the Support Group ]

## 501(c)(3)

The BIL Support Foundation is a registered 501c3 entity with the sole purpose of supporting the financial needs of BIL events happening around the world.  Paperwork for the foundation was filed in 2013

## Donations

BIL events depend on donations and sponsorship money to help run the events.  If you are running a BIL event and have someone who wants to contribute money, you should consider running those funds through the Support Foundation.  

Donations to any BIL event that are in need of a tax write off, MUST to make their checks out to the foundation as listed here:

> BIL Support Foundation
> Address Line 1
> Address Line 2
> City, State Zip

It is important to note that if you are planning on using the foundation, you need to set up your BIL event as an [official event](./Hosting a BIL/) so we can assign an account number to your event for accounting purposes.

## Money flow

Money that flows through the foundation will be returned to the BIL event after the checks clear.  Turnaround time can be from 3-7 days for the checks to clear, and then added time to send a check back to your event.  

Digital transfers can speed up the process of recieving money back to help pay for your event costs.  Options here include: Paypal, WePay, and possibly other sources, but do know that all fees for choosen services will be taken out and paid by the reciever.
