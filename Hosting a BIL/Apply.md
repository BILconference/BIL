# How to host your own BIL

## Apply

We're not crazy about implementing any strict rules for anyone who wants to throw their own BIL, we just want to make sure that effort is not being duplicated in close geographical regions.  The event is Creative Commons licensed after all, so you don't even have to tell us, but if you do, we can help you get the resources you need to make your event a hit!

Please go to [http://bilconference.com/apply_to_host](http://bilconference.com/apply_to_host) if you're sure someone is not already hosting a BIL in your area.  Fill out the form and we'll help set you up with everything you need that can't be found in these documents.

### How much should we charge?

Honestly.  You shouldn't charge anything unless you absolutely have to charge attendance to cover costs you cannot find in sponsorship or grants.  BIL was started with the mindset that quality talks and education shouldn't have to come at a cost, but sometimes we have to cover our costs in various ways.

BIL attempts to be a donation run event, with suggested donations being taken at the door that you calculate based on the cost of your event.  At our flagship event we even hold an auction at the closing of the talks.  

The goal here is not to make a profit, but to cover your costs
