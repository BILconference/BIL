# Hosting a BIL


So you want to host a BIL event in your city?  Anyone is free to open and operate a BIL, and we encourage the collaboration of a team of willing volunteers to help steer your event to success.  This document will serve as a basis of things that have worked for us in the past, and does not necessitate anything except where noted specifically.

## Venue Selection

### Location

It is important that you pick a location that is not only easy for people to come from other areas, but we have also prided ourselves on picking unique venues that have character.  People are going to be curious about what BIL is, but sometimes your venue can determine wheter a person takes the initiative to acctually attend.  

This does not mean to go and find an extravagant venue, because you will find yourself struggling to pay for it if you do.  Instead, look for under utilized venues.  These are typically venues that do not have normal event rentals, or if they do, they have off peak times where you may be able to strike a deal. 

### Size

### Available equipment

Remember, anything that is not provided by your venue will have to be brought in.  This can be quite a hassle if you are not prepared.  See our [Audio / Visual checklist]() for things you may need for your event depending on the size.

### Cost

Cost is going to vary from place to place, but a good rule of thumb is to estimate the number of people you expect that you can draw to your event and multiply that by the average donation you estimate each of them will provide you to fund the event.  Yes, this is a bit of guess work, but always estimate on the side of caution and assume people will donate less than you hope.  This will give you a rudamentary budget for venue.  

This also runs under the assumption that you cannot find anyone to help [sponsor](sponsorship.md) the event.
