# Host your own BIL

## Sponsorship

Sponsorship amounts are under the discretion of each individual BIL.  In the past the flagship BIL has been funded about 50% by sponsorship with the other half coming from attendee donations.  It is possible that you could get full funding for your event through sponsorship, or maybe just a small portion.  That is up to you how you how much burden you want to put on your funding sources.

_We do ask however that you do not allow direct solicitation or sales at your BIL event._  BIL is an event for people to learn, meet like minds, and experience each other, not to be bombarded with sales pitches.  This goes for both any booth setups or speeches on stage.  BIL is not an Expo.

If in doubt, look through this list of examples of what is and is not an acceptable BIL experience:

- Company A gives money. In exchange they want to have a speaker on stage to talk directly about their product or service and why people should buy it.  _No way!_
- Company B gives money. Company B representative gives a talk on astrophysics or particle accelerators and how their product might work with them and make the world a better place.  _Borderline, but acceptable_
- Company C gives money.  Wants to talk about something awesome, but unrelated to their product.  _BODACIOUS!_
- Company D gives money.  Wants a table or booth at your event. _Cool if they are giving away products, and not selling them (discretionary for each event, but be very careful)_
- Company E gives money.  Wants nothing but their logo on the wall and an announcement of their good will to the community.  _BODACIOUS_
- Company F does not give money.  Provides needed supplies for the event.  Gets logo on wall.  _BODACIOUS!_
- Company G does not give money.  Provides no value to the event, yet trys to peddle commercial goods and services. Individuals networking is acceptable. _NO WAY!_

Sponsors that request tax deductable donations should follow the directions for donating directly to the [BIL Support Foundation]() which will in turn give them the tax write off and pass the money through to you.
