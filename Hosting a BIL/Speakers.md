# Speakers

## Community Stages

Community stages, or whiteboard slots as we call them are the bread and butter of BIL.  We want everyone to have the opportunity to be involved in and impact the event. If you have something interesting you would like to talk to the group about, you will have your 15 minutes to get up and talk about it assuming you signed up for an available slot.

## Inviting Speakers

We incourage the formal invitation to speakers to come speak at your event.  We don't suggest you fill up your stages with invited speakers, but it is good practice to get a few well knowns in the lineup to attract attendance.

## Speaker Compensation

It has been our policy to not pay for speakers.  If you choose to pay to have an important speaker be at your event, then this is at your discretion.  You are not bound by a no payment policy, but we do ask that you consider just why you want a specific speaker so badly you're willing to pay to have them at your event.  Don't blow your whole budget trying to get a single person to speak about a single topic when you have hundereds of amazing and talented individuals who are willing to talk to your group within driving distance of you.  Sometimes the best ideas come from the people who go unheard most of the time.
